# Eleven Labs Text to Speech
This repository provides a Python script for converting text to speech using the Eleven Labs API. The script takes in text input, along with the user's Eleven Labs voice ID and API key, and returns the corresponding audio output.

## Installation

## Copy code
    pip3 install gradio requests

## Usage

This will open a Gradio interface where you can input the desired text, voice ID, and API key. The output will be audio corresponding to the input text.
